# Random Tasks App

An application where you can:

1. With as few taps as possible, add a new task to my â€œrandom stream of distraction tasks" 
2. When I have ~5 minutes, ask for a task from this stream, randomly
3. Mark a Task as completed & filter it out of random results
4. Set weights (probabilities) on Tasks

This is for tasks that are "distractions" -- that don't have to get done and maybe I shouldn't take the time to do. Putting them in a "random stream" helps me trick myself into letting go of them.
